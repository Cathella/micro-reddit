# Micro Reddit Project

We were tasked with creating models for a Reddit clone. These included the Post, Comment and User models. We added associations that connected them to each other using relationships via Foreign Keys(FK). We also added validations to the model attributes such that it has to pass certain constraints before they get submitted to the database.
